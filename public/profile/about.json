    "about": "I'm Saravjit Singh, a Software Engineer and M.S. Computer Science student at Northeastern University (2025–2027). I build performant, accessible web apps and services across React, Next.js, .NET (Core/C#), and Sitecore, with prior experience shipping production features for high‑traffic sites and integrating CI quality gates (SonarQube, Docker). Previously at Q3 Technologies and Altudo, I delivered measurable gains in load time, publishing velocity, and reliability; at Nvidia, I optimized video pipelines with C++ and CUDA. I enjoy solving practical problems end‑to‑end—from data modeling and APIs to clean, responsive UIs.",
